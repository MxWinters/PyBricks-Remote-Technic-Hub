# PyBricks-Remote-Technic-Hub
Pybricks software for using the PoweredUp Remote with the LEGO Technic hub.

The code allows for 2 different control modes, Precision Mode and Band Band Mode.
Precision Mode is basically a speed controller for the drive motors and increments the motor speed by 10%. It also increments the steering motor by 10Â°.
Bang Bang Mode acts as a simple on/off controller for the drive motors and turns the steering motor all the way to the endstop.

# Install
Simply download the main.py to your device, open it with the PyBricks app or with Chrome, configure it as per below and then flash the code to the Technic Hub in the normal way.

# Configuration
1. Set which Controller Mode you want the hub to start with in the Set Startup Controller Mode.
2. Set the user definable settings in the "User Definable Variables" section.
3. Set the motor settings in the "Initialize The Motors" section.
