# PyBricks-Remote-Technic-Hub
Pybricks software for using the PoweredUp Remote with the LEGO Technic hub.

The code allows for 2 different control modes, Precision Mode and Band Band Mode.
Precision Mode is basically a speed controller for the drive motors and increments the motor speed by 10%. It also increments the steering motor by 10Â°.
Bang Bang Mode acts as a simple on/off controller for the drive motors and turns the steering motor all the way to the endstop.
